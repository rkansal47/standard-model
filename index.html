<!--  l. 117  --><p class="noindent">These are a set of notes introducing the standard model (SM) of particle physics
and the mathematical frameworks underpinning it: group theory and quantum
field theory. They were intended as theoretical background for my  <a href="https://www.raghavkansal.com">dissertation</a>
but, as is perhaps evident, they quickly grew beyond that scope. Instead, they are
now presented here as a standalone resource, to complement the many
excellent texts available on these subjects (as anyone who has struggled
through QFT knows, there can never be too many)! With these notes, in
particular, I aim as much as possible to highlight the physics behind the math,
rather than provide any rigorous derivations, and to clarify those aspects
that confused me most as an experimentalist trying to understand the
SM.
                                                                          

                                                                          
</p><!--  l. 122  --><p class="indent">   These notes are available as both a  <a href="google.com">PDF</a> and  <a href="https://rkansal47.github.io/standard-model">website</a>. Feedback
and corrections are very welcome through e-mail or as  <a href="google.com">issues</a> on Github.
In particular, this is my first time trying to convert from LaTeX to a
website, so there may be many formatting issues I have missed. Finally, for
those interested, some more notes and tutorials I have written up, such as
on machine learning and statistics in high energy physics, are available
<a href="https://www.raghavkansal.com/teaching/">here</a>.
